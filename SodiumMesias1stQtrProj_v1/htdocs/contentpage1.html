				<p> Racism is a process in which actions, attitudes, policies, and such create unequal opportunities. This is the belief that certain groups are better than the others based on their race. It can come in many forms. It can be in the form of speaking, thinking, acting, and such. There are also different types of racism which are individual or internalized, interpersonal, institutional, and structural racism. Individual or internalized racism is the racism that exists within individuals. Xenophobic feelings or one's internalized sense of oppression or privilige is an example of it. Interpersonal racism is the racism that occurs between individuals. It is when one thinks of negative thoughts towards another race or culture. Institutional racism is when institutional or cultural practices perpetuate racial inequality. Structural racism is when joint institutions produce racist outcomes, even with the absence of racist intent.</p>

			<p> During the 19th century, racism existed as "scientific racism". It attempted to create a racial classification on humanity. There are many different ways on how people tried to classify human beings. One example is the polygenist view. It was created by Christoph Meiners in which he split mankind into two, which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". He claimed that race can either be viewed as beautiful or ugly. He considered only the white race as pretty, while he considered that the black race as inferior, and animal-like. Another example is the division of mankind suggested by Johann Blumenbach. He divided mankind into five groups(Caucasian, Mongolian, Malayan, Ethiopian, and American) according to the color of their skin, positing a view that the non-Caucasians had risen through the process of degeneration. </p>

				<p> Racism is different from prejudice. It is when this prejudice is accompanied by the power to discriminate, oppress or limit the rights of others. Racism also adapts and changes over time, and can impact many people in different ways. One recent example is when other people started to label asians as someone who has a virus because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Historically, those who practiced racism believed that the low-status races should be limited to low-status jobs, while those who are regarded as high-status should have exclusive access to political power, and high-status jobs. Those who are in the low-class experience violence, daily insults and frequent violations of their human rights. We can see that racism has been around for a long time. </p>
